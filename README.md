## Challenges I ran into üò∂ 
Being a beginner in software development, I had no experience using Circle CI/CD and tried first time directly in the hackathon, we thought of deploying our website using CI/CD pipeline and learn about this integration so , we have used heroku to connect and deploy but at first we dont know how to deploy static pages using circle ci/cd,and facing many errors some examples are :

and so many but we tried our best to deploy this using circle ci/cd we googled for various resources to accomplish this and compelete in the hackathon only and gues what at the end we successfully deployed it , after so much bugs with the help of php.


## Accomplishments that I am proud of üòé
I and my friend was able to overcome all the challenges and was able to create a completely functional prototype. I was able to fetch the data and  I am most proud of the fact that this product will be able to help many people across the globe.Also , I and my friend got to know about basics of circle ci/cd.
  
  

## What's next for Phenomenal Women
I decided to add some Lufi music functionality and authentication with bookmarks to save the repos for a particular person.
